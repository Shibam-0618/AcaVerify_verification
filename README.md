OCR-Based Certificate Verification

This project includes an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module that allows automatic extraction and verification of certificate details. Users can upload images or PDF versions of certificates, and the system will detect key information such as student name, roll number, course, institution, year, grade, and certificate number. The extracted data is then cross-checked to determine authenticity and flag any suspicious or invalid certificates. This feature leverages Tesseract.js for OCR processing and pdf.js for rendering PDF files, ensuring accurate recognition and a seamless verification experience.
